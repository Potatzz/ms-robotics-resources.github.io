# How to do Simple Tasks Fast
This tutorial will go over doing some things faster. For example, using a screwdriver faster! It will also give some tips and suggestions when working on the robot!

# Not Taking Ages to Screw in a Screw with a Screwdriver or Allen Key
roll ur fingers on the hex shaft part of it (elaborate)

This strategy to screwing in screws can make having to screw in a lot of screws quick and efficient! Of course, if its too dificult or tight to just use your fingers you can always go back to twisting your hand.

# Using a Wrench-Driver and Screwdriver to Unscrew and Screw in Nuts Easier and Faster
twist both at the same time

Not only can this make the connection tigher and therefore stronger, it also makes it faster since the nut is moving twice as fast! 

# Make A Rhythm and Find Shortcuts
If you ever need to repeat a task a lot, or need to take apart and rebuild a component over and over and over again, try and get into a rhythm or find a shortcut! It'll help you do it faster, and make it feel less of a pain to redo it again and again.\
For example, putting in a motor can sometimes be a pain. You have to add on the front bracket with 4 screws, then screw in the bracket with another 4 screws at various angles. You also have to add on whatever the motor is driving!\
Most of the time, you don't need to remove the bracket on the motor, so you can just keep that on. If you do need to remove the bracket, sometimes you can access the 4 screws connected to the motor without having to take everything apart.

In general, finding ways to speed up these sort of repair/testing tasks can make them feel way less annoying and they're faster so you can move on to the next project quicker!

# General Things You Should Do
not have 2in long screws for a connection thats like 20mm thick. \
dont screw things TOO tight, make them snug. We have locknuts for a reason :)\
get a friend to help you support things if you're struggling to add something to the robot! it makes it easier and faster!\
keep everything organized, it may seem monotonous, but it helps later on
