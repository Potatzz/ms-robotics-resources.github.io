# This Page is for People who Need to add Pages to the Website!

Adding pages to the site is really simple. In GitHub, create a new file with the name of the page (people can see this so make it simple/descriptive), ***THE NAME CANNOT HAVE ANY UPPERCASE OR SPACES***. Also add ".md" as the file extension.
  
For the actual text of the file, it should be about what the page is about! There isn't any special stuff you need to do for adding text, just type it in!  
If you need special text, the discord format is pretty similar to how to format stuff in a .md file.  
  
Here are a few simple things you can do:  
Using a # and a space allows you create headers  
# Like this!  
  
Using a * on two sides of a word or phrase will put something in italics  
*sideways*  
  
Using two * on two sides of a word or phrase will put something in bold!  
**thicc**  
(you can also stack italics and bold ***like this!***)  
  
**For adding newlines, or keeping lines as newlines, put two spaces at the end of a line (or in an empty line to make a break in text)**  
  
For other text things you can use [this site](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) :)  
  
  
  
# IMPORTANT:
When making a new page, make sure you add this to the bottom:  
\
\[Home Page](https://potatzz.github.io/ms-robotics-resources.github.io/) || \[Table of Contents](https://potatzz.github.io/ms-robotics-resources.github.io/table_of_contents.html)  
\
It helps people navigate back to the home page or to the table of contents :)  

You should also add your page to the table of contents page (or ask me, I'm fine with it as well).  
\
You can do it by putting \[the text that will display](the link to your page.html) **(MAKE SURE YOU PUT .HTML INSTEAD OF .MD!)**  
\
For this page you should put something like \[Adding Pages Guide](https://potatzz.github.io/ms-robotics-resources.github.io/adding_pages.html)  
\
also please put the pages in the correct categories... I don't want to have to move them or have people get confused .-.
